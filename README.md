# Dingy & The Dungeon
The final project for our Game Development Fundamentals class.

Currently, it's a minimum viable product with some art. Not much more than that, and probably never will be.

## Lore
A swordfish mouse has escaped the testing facilities, and a bunch of mad scientist cats (that look like burritos) are after you.
Fight them, or die. The game will get harder as the waves progress.
