# Dingy & The Dungeon
The final project for our Game Development Fundamentals class.
Built with GoDot. No (working) executable has been released; you'll have to run it from inside GoDot.

## Lore
A swordfish mouse has escaped the testing facilities, and a bunch of mad scientist cats are after you.
Fight them, or die. The game will get harder as the waves progress.
